# MythDeck
This is a very old experiment i did a long time ago!

## How to install
- Download this project from this repo using clone button
- Download <a href="https://nwjs.io/" target="_blank">NW.js</a> and extract it where you want
- Extract the files from this repo on nw.exe folder
- Run nw.exe

### Important info
- 90%+ of this code stinks!
- Use NW.js 0.38.2 for this project - it will run better!
- I will not update this project. If you <i>want</i> to update it by yourself, create a PR!
